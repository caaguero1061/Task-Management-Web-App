# Task Management Web App

## Name
Cassandra Aguero
## Overview
A React task management application that lets users create, view, complete, delete, and filter todos.  
It also includes a Contact page with a fully controlled form.
## How to Use / Functionality
- Use the navigation bar to switch between:
  - **/todos**: Add tasks, mark tasks complete, delete tasks, and filter tasks (all/completed/incomplete).
  - **/contact**: Fill out a controlled contact form (first name, last name, email, comments).
- Completed todos are visually distinct (strike-through styling).
- Filter todos
As a user, I want to view all / completed / incomplete tasks, so I can focus on what matters.
## Wireframes
Layout
Top: Horizontal NavBar (links: Todos, Contact)
Main content below nav:
Left column: “New Todo” form (side-by-side requirement)
Text input
Submit button
Filter buttons/links: All | Completed | Incomplete
Right column: Todo list
Each todo row shows:
checkbox or “Complete” button
todo text
remove/delete button
Completed items show a strike-through (or faded style)
## Technologies Used
- React (Create React App)
- React Router
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- (Optional) Redux / Redux Toolkit
## Ideas for Future Improvement
1. Persist todos using LocalStorage or a database API so tasks remain after refresh.
2. Add an “Edit todo” feature and due dates/priority tags.
3. Add form validation and success/error messages on the Contact page.
4. Create navbar layout
